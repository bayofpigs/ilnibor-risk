Suggestions:

Undo function
Restart game function
Music/Sounds
Highlighting the country's borders when selected
Add more names to the names.txt

Errors:
nullpointer exception in the beginning if the user declines to enter names and clicks cancel, but remains on the main menu panel

I've noticed that the one below only happens sometimes, so be patient if you decide to attempt to discover and fix the bug

concurrent modification error at udateGame() at the end of the game (probably has to do with the fact that a list is being
modified within a For Each loop), and probably because of that:
	doesnt stop game and winner keeps playing
	doesn't display "end of game"
	doesn't display winner's name in msgbox
